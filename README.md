This project was completed as part of the Database course in the 10th semester of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

For STUDYstics, the goal is to build a Database that will contain data on postgraduate programs. The application will include programs from a wide range of universities worldwide, 
compare them, and guide the candidate to the postgraduate program that suits them. The priority is to provide a centralized presentation of the programs that will help the candidate make the best choice, 
avoiding any confusion in the processes.
STUDYstics, will store data about the postgraduate programmes, the courses they contain, the professors who teach in them and the requirements they have
from prospective students. Prospective users of the application are senior students looking for the right postgraduate programme for them and university professors who want to design new programmes or establish new partnerships.
